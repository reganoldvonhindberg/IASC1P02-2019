		<h1>Who are we?</h1>
		<p>Well, it’s good you asked! We are the Slow Turtle Network!
			Here at the STN, we pride ourselves on journalistic abilities to provide the public with the most important news. Unlike other news networks that give you your news as fast as possible, we here at STN take at least 1 day to 5 months to dissect any information that comes our way and provide you with the real facts. Here at STN we have over 10 journalists, I think, and at least 1 technician who comes by sometimes. What do any of these people do? I don’t know, I was just paid to write this article. We are locally based in 5 different cities that are all in Australia. Our specialty is being to provide you with news based in countries that our reporters have never been to.

		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h3>How can I contact the STN?</h3>
		<p>You try to find us in the streets dressed up as Santa Claus with a laptop in hand. Please do not try to figure out our office numbers or email addresses as we will not like that. If you do manage to contact us through those means We will attempt to hunt you down and give you a very strongly worded piece of paper that should rip your entire being into two.</p>
		<h3>How Can I work for STN?</h3>
		<p>We’ll contact you when we believe you’re ready.</p>
		<h3>What if I Have Feedback on an article?</h3>
		<p>Tweet at us and see if we block or not!</p>
		<h3>Can I submit ideas to STN?</h3>
		<p>Yes, we will gladly take your ideas and use them as our own! Please do not expect to be credited for the idea, anything posted on our website is our property and domain. This is not legally enforceable but we will send you spam mail. Submit any submissions to the email address below.</p>
		<p>submissions@slowturtlenetwork.ca</p>
		<h3>Wait didn’t you say not to figure out your Email addresses?</h3>
		<p>Yes, only use that email addresses for idea submissions nothing else! Also, you saw nothing!</p>
		<h3>Why do I keep getting redirected to this page?</h3>
		<p>That’s because we didn’t pay our technician enough to finish the website and have been trying our best to keep the site running while after he kicked him out for demanding to get paid.</p>
		<h3>What Time is it?</h3>
		<p id="Time">hellow</p>
		<h3>Fine then what are you're services?</h3>
		<p>We'll spy on you without you knowing. We'll send a reporter to anywhere at any time. We'll post something on this website. And uh... that's about it. We don't do a whole lot. I kinda wish I managed to do something with my life rather than continually posting false information on a website no one knows about. I’m fairly certain that you don’t exist either but instead are just the imaginary voice in my head that I talk to keep myself occupied.</p>
